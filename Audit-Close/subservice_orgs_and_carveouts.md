# Subservice Organizations and Carved-Out Controls

## Key Concept

In a SOC 2 audit, not all systems or business units need to be included. If certain functions are handled by **subservice organizations** (third parties), and those functions do not directly impact the core system under audit, they can be **carved out** of the report.

> ðŸ”¹ Carve-Out = Exclusion from the audit scope  
> ðŸ”¹ Inclusive = Included in the audit scope and testing

## When Carve-Out is Appropriate

- Internal departments that don't impact customer data
- Vendors managing non-critical systems
- Internal financial systems (in a non-financial audit)

These exclusions should be **agreed upon and documented before the audit begins**.



## Example

If a cloud-based company uses a third-party HR system that doesn't store or process customer data, it can **carve out** that system.



## Takeaway

Always identify and document subservice orgs ahead of the audit, and decide if they'll be:
- **Included** in testing
- Or **carved out**, with responsibilities clearly transferred

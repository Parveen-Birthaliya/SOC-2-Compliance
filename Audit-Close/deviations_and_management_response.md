# Deviations and Management's Response

After the **audit period ends** and the audit team shares a **preliminary SOC 2 report**, the organization's **management team** is given a chance to review the findings.

## What is a Management Response?
- A **management response** is the organization’s official reply to the auditor’s findings.
- It is **not mandatory**, but it is **highly recommended**, especially if:
  - **Deviations** were identified
  - A **control failed** or was marked as **not operating effectively**
  - There was a **recent change** in the process or system related to the failed control

## Why Respond?
This is management’s opportunity to:
- **Clarify or explain** why a deviation occurred
- **Provide additional context** (e.g., a control was recently updated)
- **Demonstrate awareness** and show that a **remediation plan** is in place or ongoing

## When to Use It:
If the auditors report a control failure, and you know that:
- The failure was due to a **temporary issue**, or
- The control was **recently replaced or improved**,  
then the **management response** can be used to **document this explanation** formally.

## Example:
Let's say the audit notes that backup processes failed one month during the review period. In your management response, you could write:
> "The deviation occurred due to a configuration issue introduced during a migration. The issue was identified and remediated on [Date], and a monitoring alert has been implemented to prevent recurrence."

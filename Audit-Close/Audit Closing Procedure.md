# Audit Closing Procedure

### When the audit concludes:
- The **auditing team** will notify you that the audit review is over.
- The final report will typically be ready within **2 to 4 weeks**. 
  - Though it may seem like a long time, the **organization** should start preparing for the next audit cycle.

### Finalizing the Report:
- After reviewing the evidence and forming their opinion, the auditors will send the **final report** to the organization's **management team**.
- During this time:
  - Itâ€™s a good practice for the **management team** to review the report individually first.
  - Then, review the report **together as a group** to discuss any final thoughts or necessary actions.

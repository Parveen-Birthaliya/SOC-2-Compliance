# Organizing a Closing Meeting and Stating the Conclusion of the Audit

### When to Organize the Closing Meeting:
- Once **management** has reviewed the audit report, it’s time to set up a **closing meeting** with the auditors.

### Preparing for the Meeting:
- Management should prepare a list of **questions** for the auditors ahead of time. Some example questions to ask:
  - **Clarification on Findings**: Can you clarify the reason behind the findings or deviations in the audit?
  - **Control Effectiveness**: Were any of the controls found to be ineffective, and if so, why?
  - **Evidence Gaps**: Were there any gaps in the evidence provided that led to findings or delays in the audit process?
  - **Risk Areas**: Are there any risk areas you recommend the organization focus on to avoid future deviations?
  - **Next Steps**: What would be the next steps for remediation, and what timeline do you suggest for addressing these issues?

### Who Should Attend the Closing Meeting:
- If **deviations** were found during the audit, the **manager** of the affected department should attend the meeting.
  - This ensures direct communication between:
    - The **organization’s management team**,
    - The **auditors**,
    - The **manager** of the department where the deviation was identified.



### Key Points:
1. **Prepare for the Meeting**: Management should have their questions ready.
2. **Attendees**: Include the department manager if deviations were found to clarify and discuss any shortcomings.

# SOC 2 Marketing & Logo Usage

##  Marketing Collaboration

During the audit, cross-team communication is key — especially with the **marketing team**. After a successful audit:

- Work with marketing to publish compliant messaging
- Share the news across social media, blogs, email newsletters
- Communicate to clients: “We’ve been independently audited and have a SOC 2 report available!”

##  Logo Usage

Once you pass and receive your attestation report:
- You’re allowed to use the **AICPA SOC 2 logo**
- This can be used in marketing materials, presentations, and the company website
- It adds credibility and trust for prospective clients

>  Make sure to follow AICPA's official logo usage guidelines.

## Summary

- Maintain trust across internal teams
- Leverage the audit success externally
- Use the logo with care and compliance

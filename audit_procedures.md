# Audit Procedures and Evaluation of Evidence (Auditors' Point of View)

Once the audit period has been agreed upon between the auditing firm and the organization, it becomes your responsibility (as lead implementer or consultant) to:

- Gather and document the audit timelines  
- Understand the procedures followed by the auditors  



## Example: High-Level Audit Procedure (SOC 2)

1. Gap analysis is performed  
2. Remediation (if needed)  
3. Audit firm is selected  
4. Audit dates are finalized  
5. Audit officially begins  
6. Evidence is collected during the audit period  
7. Evidence is internally reviewed  
8. Evidence is submitted to auditors  
9. Auditors review the submitted evidence  
10. Final opinion is issued by the audit firm  

**Note**: This is a general flow—not an exhaustive list. Actual steps may vary depending on the organization and auditor.



## Internal Evidence Review

Not all companies have a dedicated **internal audit function**.

In such cases:
- You, as the lead implementer, may be expected to **review and validate** collected evidence.
- This adds more responsibility but also more billable hours for you.
- It’s a key opportunity to ensure the audit proceeds smoothly.

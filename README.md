##  What is SOC 2?

**SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2)** is a voluntary compliance framework developed by the AICPA. It ensures that service providers securely manage customer data to protect the interests of the organization and the privacy of its clients. It focuses on five **Trust Service Criteria (TSC)**:
- Security
- Availability
- Processing Integrity
- Confidentiality
- Privacy

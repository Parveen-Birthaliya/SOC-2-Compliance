# Audit Findings and Deviations

→ **Auditors** are usually paid based on the number of findings or deviations they uncover. They already have the tools and knowledge to spot these deviations. 

→ They also use **metrics** depending on the size of the organization to decide if something is wrong.



### What happens after the audit period:

- After the organization submits its evidence, the **auditing team** reviews everything.
- This process usually involves **two or more auditors** going through the evidence and analyzing it thoroughly.


### Possible outcomes during this review:

1. **More questions** → They might ask for additional info or clarification.
2. **Write up a finding** → If something is wrong, they’ll document it.
3. **Move on** → If everything looks good, they’ll continue.

### Impact of audit deviations:

- If **deviations** are found, it can negatively affect the **SOC 2 attestation report**.
  - This could lead to **qualified**, **disclaimer**, or **adverse opinions**.
- It’s **crucial** to have **internal teams** constantly reviewing evidence to make sure controls are working as expected.


### What happens after deviations are found:

- Once **deviations** are noted, auditors will add them to the **SOC 2 report**.
- These deviations will be listed with a status:
  - **No exceptions noted** (everything is fine)
  - **Reason for failure** (why that control failed)
- The findings will be documented in the **"results of service auditors' test of controls"** column.

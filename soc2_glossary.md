# SOC 2 Glossary of Terms

## Gap Analysis
An assessment of an organization's current processes, procedures, and technologies to identify discrepancies between the **current state** and the **desired future state**.

## Risk Assessment
The process of evaluating potential risks that may impact systems, processes, or platforms. This helps prioritize control implementation based on risk severity and likelihood.

## CIA Triad (AIC Triad)
A foundational model in cybersecurity representing:
- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity**
- **Availability**

Note: Also referred to as the **AIC Triad** to avoid confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency.

## AICPA
**American Institute of Certified Public Accountants** — the national professional organization responsible for issuing the SOC 2 compliance framework.

## Audit
An independent examination of an organization's systems, controls, and security posture. Can be performed by internal auditors or a certified third-party firm.

## SOC 2
A voluntary **compliance framework** issued by AICPA. It evaluates the effectiveness of controls relevant to **security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy** (TSC).

## Vulnerability Scanner
Software or hardware tools that identify security vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications.

## Source Code Analysis
Automated or manual examination of source code to identify security flaws **before deployment to production**. Often part of a secure development lifecycle (SDLC).

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
An authentication method that requires at least **two factors**:
- Something you know (password)
- Something you have (token)
- Something you are (biometric)

## NIST
**National Institute of Standards and Technology** — U.S. agency that publishes cybersecurity guidelines such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and NIST SP 800-53.

## Deviation
A condition where an implemented control **does not operate as intended** or **fails to meet the defined criteria** during an audit.

## Compensating Control
An alternate control that reduces risk when a primary (or ideal) control is **not feasible** due to cost, complexity, or technical limitations.

## Audit Scope
Defines the **boundaries** of the audit, including:
- Systems and infrastructure reviewed
- Policies and procedures evaluated
- Controls tested

## Anti-Malware
Software designed to prevent, detect, and remove various forms of **malicious software**, including:
- Viruses
- Worms
- Trojans
- Spyware
- Adware
- Keyloggers

## Technical Control
A control implemented via a **technical system or device**.

**Examples:**
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Anti-malware tools
- Firewalls
- Access control systems

## Procedural Control
A control that relies on **defined processes or standard operating procedures**.

**Examples:**
- User access reviews
- Endpoint compliance checks
- Change management approvals

## Administrative Control
Controls derived from **policies, standards, and procedures** established by management.

**Examples:**
- Company security policy
- Code of conduct
- Data classification policy
- Training and awareness programs

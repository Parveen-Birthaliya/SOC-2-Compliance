# Communication During an Audit

During an audit period, as a consultant or lead implementer, it's important to work across multiple departments within the organization. Based on the structure of most companies, the departments you're likely to interact with include:

- Human Resources  
- Information Technology  
- DevOps / Engineering  
- Executive Level  
- Information Security  
- Board of Directors  
- Marketing



## Key Responsibilities During the Audit



- Timelines  
- Evidence collection  
- Gaps found in existing controls or processes



## Communication With Auditors



- Explaining how certain controls are implemented  
- Submitting additional or specific evidence  
- Clarifying any follow-up questions



## Communication With Executive Team

- Overall audit status  
- Any critical findings or gaps  
- Risks that might affect the audit outcome



## Final Note

As a lead implementer, you're basically the bridge between auditors, internal teams, and leadership. Keeping everyone aligned is a big part of getting a successful SOC 2 attestation.
